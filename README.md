# Django testing

Just me pushing myself, but now with Django.

By now, it is a web with a log in. It saves your information and leaves you in the main page, with no more than a welcome message. It also save the LOGGING INFO level data in a local file. This file will be created once you run the app in the same folder and it's called "logs".

Thinking about what's next.
